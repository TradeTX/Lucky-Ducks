# Lucky-Ducks

Help Chuck the Duck find the lucky duck out of the group to win prizes! Temporarily, a contest will be held to earn real money as listed on the site.

Built with Bootstrap on the front-end, with Node, Express, and MySQL/Sequelize on the back-end. Also includes Nightmare for testing and Passport for user authentication. The gameplay was made using Javascript and a lot of members of Chuck the Duck's family.
